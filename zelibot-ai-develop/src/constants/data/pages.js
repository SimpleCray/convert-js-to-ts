    <b><u>PRIVACY</b></u> 
    <br>
    This Policy applies to all personal information collected by Zeligate Pty Ltd via the website located at www.Zeligate.ai</p>
    <br>
    <b>&emsp;1.&emsp;What is "personal information"?</b>
    <br>
    <p>&emsp;(a)&emsp;The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) currently defines "personal information" as meaning information or an 
    opinion about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable:</p>
    <br>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(i)&emsp;whether the information or opinion is true or not; and</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(ii)&emsp;whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&emsp;(b)&emsp;If the information does not disclose your identity or enable your identity to be ascertained, 
    it will in most cases not be classified as "personal information" and will not be subject to this privacy policy.</p>
    <br>
    <b>&emsp;2.&emsp;What information do we collect?</b>
    <p>The kind of personal information that we collect from you will depend on how you use the website. The personal 
    information which we collect and hold about you may include: login credentials, payment details, email address, 
    business address, name,  phone number, country location, company documents.</p>
    <br>
    <b>&emsp;3.&emsp;How we collect your personal information?</b>
    <br>
    <p>&emsp;(a)&emsp;We may collect personal information from you whenever you input such information into the website.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&emsp;(b)&emsp;We also collect cookies from your computer which enable us to tell when you use the website and 
    also to help customise your website experience. As a general rule, however, it is not possible to identify you personally 
    from our use of cookies.</p>
    <br>
    <b>&emsp;4.&emsp;Purpose of collection</b>
    <br>
    <p>&emsp;(a)&emsp;The purpose for which we collect personal information is to provide you with the best service 
    <br>
    <p>&emsp;(b)&emsp;We customarily disclose personal information only to our service providers who assist us in 
    operating the website and product. Your personal information may also be exposed from time to time to maintenance and 
    support personnel acting in the normal course of their duties.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&emsp;(c)&emsp;By using our website, you consent to the receipt of direct marketing material. We will only use your personal
    information for this purpose if we have collected such information directly from you, and if it is material of a type 
    which you would reasonably expect to receive from us.  We do not use sensitive personal information in direct marketing 
    activity.  Our direct marketing material will include a means by which you can request not to receive further communications 
    of this nature.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
    <b>&emsp;5.&emsp;Access and correction</b>
    <br>
    Australian Privacy Principle 12 permits you to obtain access to the personal information we hold about you in certain 
    circumstances, and Australian Privacy Principle 13 allows you to correct inaccurate personal information subject to 
    certain exceptions. If you would like to obtain such access, please contact us as set out below.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
    <b>&emsp;6.&emsp;Complaint procedure</b>
    <br>
    If you have a complaint concerning the manner in which we maintain the privacy of your personal information, please 
    contact us as set out below. All complaints will be considered by Vickie King and we may seek further information 
    from you to clarify your concerns. If we agree that your complaint is well founded, we will, in consultation with you, 
    take appropriate steps to rectify the problem. If you remain dissatisfied with the outcome, you may refer the matter 
    to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
    <b>&emsp;7.&emsp;Overseas transfer</b>
    <br>
    Your personal information may be transferred to recipients who assist us in operating the website and product. These 
    recipients may be located in other countries, for example this includes AWS located in the US. By agreeing, you 
    acknowledge that if your personal information is mishandled in those jurisdictions, we will not bear responsibility, 
    and you will not have recourse under Australian law.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
    <b>&emsp;8.&emsp;GDPR</b>
    <br>
    In some circumstances, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides additional protection to
     individuals located in Europe. The fact that you may be located in Europe does not, however, on its own entitle you to 
     protection under the GDPR. Our website does not specifically target customers located in the European Union and we do 
     not monitor the behavior of individuals in the European Union, and accordingly the GDPR does not apply.
    </p>
